This part lays the foundation for analyzing data within the Web3 space, which revolves around blockchain technology. It combines data science principles with decentralized systems to help us understand how Web3 metrics work and how to handle blockchain data effectively.

#### Where Data and Web3 Meet

This section explains that Web3 creates a new world where data is not only decentralized but also publicly accessible on blockchains. It emphasizes how data analysis plays a crucial role in understanding blockchain activity, decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and more.

---

#### Technical Requirements

Before starting, we need certain tools:

* Web3 libraries (e.g., Web3.js, ethers.js)
* Blockchain nodes or services (like Infura or Alchemy)
* Familiarity with APIs to extract blockchain data
* Programming knowledge (typically Python, JavaScript)

---

#### Exploring the Data Ingredients

Here, the book breaks down what kind of data is essential in Web3 analysis:

* On-chain data (transactions, wallet addresses)
* Off-chain data (market prices, social media sentiment)
* Token data (supply, transfers)
  This is the raw material for analyzing user activity, smart contracts, and token economies.

---

#### Understanding the Blockchain Ingredients

This section explains key blockchain components:

* Blocks: Collections of transactions
* Transactions: Actions executed on-chain (e.g., sending tokens)
* Addresses: Wallets or contracts involved in the transactions
* Smart Contracts: Programs running on the blockchain
  These ingredients are the building blocks for any data extraction and analysis.

#### Three Generations of Blockchain

The book describes how blockchain evolved in three phases:

1. **Blockchain 1.0** — Focused on cryptocurrency (Bitcoin)
2. **Blockchain 2.0** — Introduced smart contracts (Ethereum)
3. **Blockchain 3.0** — Expanded to decentralized apps (dApps), DeFi, NFTs, and scalability improvements (Polkadot, Solana)

#### Making the First Transaction

This is a practical guide where we learn to send our first transaction on a blockchain. It helps us understand gas fees, transaction hashes, and confirmations, which are important when analyzing transaction data later.

---

#### Approaching Web3 Industry Metrics

This section introduces the common metrics analysts track in Web3:

* **Block height**: The current length of the blockchain
* **Time**: Timestamps of blocks and transactions
* **Tokenomics**: Study of token supply, inflation, distribution
* **Total Value Locked (TVL)**: Value of assets locked in DeFi protocols
* **Total market cap**: Overall value of the blockchain ecosystem

---

#### Data Quality Challenges

Since blockchain data is decentralized and permissionless, challenges arise:

* Incomplete off-chain data
* Duplicate or spam transactions
* Anonymous actors making it hard to classify user types

---

#### Data Standards Challenges

Web3 lacks universal standards. Each blockchain may log data differently, and NFTs might follow different metadata formats (ERC-721 vs ERC-1155). This inconsistency makes cross-chain analysis harder.

---

#### Retail & NFT Floor Price Concepts

* **Retail** refers to individual users trading in small amounts (vs institutions).
* **NFT Floor Price** is the lowest price listed for an NFT in a collection, an important metric for analyzing NFT market trends.

---

#### The Concept of "Lost"

This explains that tokens or NFTs can be "lost" due to forgotten private keys or inaccessible wallets. It's an important consideration in token supply and on-chain analysis.

---

#### A Brief Overview of APIs

APIs (like Moralis, The Graph, Covalent) are tools we use to access blockchain data efficiently without running a full node. They help with querying historical data, aggregating metrics, and simplifying analysis tasks.

---

#### Summary

This part sets the stage for Web3 data analysis by covering:

* How blockchain data works
* Key industry metrics
* The tools and challenges involved in collecting and analyzing decentralized data
